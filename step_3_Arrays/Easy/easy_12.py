# Given an array of nums of n integers. 
# Every integer in the array appears twice except one integer.
# Find the number that appeared once in the array.

# Examples:
# Input : nums = [1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 1, 4]
# Output : 3

# Input : nums = [5]
# Output : 5

# def appeared_once(nums):
#     count = 0
#     for i in range (len(nums)-1):
#         nums[i]
#         for j in range(len(nums)-1):
